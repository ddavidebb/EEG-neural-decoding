# EEG-neural-decoding
EEG neural decoding for lower limb during gait using machine learning and neural networks

Still haven't added the instructions on how to use the code just yet. Will be working on this soon.

The data can be accessed via Scientific Data: https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201874
